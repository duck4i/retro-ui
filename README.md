## Retro-LLama demo 

To demonstrate usage of retro-ui components in practice we wanted to build something that combines both modern and antique, and hence the LLM AI driven project with a retro UI named **Retro Llama** was born.

You can try the [retro-llama](https://retro-llama.pages.dev/) here.

## Documentation 

This project provides the interactive documentation with code samples [here](https://retro-ui.pages.dev/).
